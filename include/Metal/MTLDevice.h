/*! The selectors below are deliberately NOT declared, so a caller that reaches
 for one gets an unrecognised selector naming the gap. Each is a question about
 the hardware that indium cannot answer, and a plausible answer would be worse
 than the error:

 -supportsCounterSampling: asks what the underlying GPU can do. MTLCounterSamplingPoint
 enumerates where Metal may sample counters, and indium has no query pool at all,
 so it has no sampling point to report on. It is not declared until indium can say
 something true.

 -supportsFamily: IS declared, and answers for Apple1 only. MTLGPUFamily is Apple's own
 numbering of silicon generations and Vulkan has no property that maps onto it --
 deviceName is a free-form string and vendorID/deviceID identify the driver, not
 the GPU family. So this does not ask indium; it answers for the hardware Darling's
 Metal is written against, and NO for every other family. A caller asking about a
 family we do not claim takes the conservative branch, which is the one that cannot
 select a path we cannot run.

 -minimumLinearTextureAlignmentForPixelFormat: returns the alignment Metal
 requires of a linear texture's offset and rowBytes, per pixel format, and
 throws for depth, stencil and compressed formats. Apple states the requirement
 but not the table, so there is nothing here to derive a value from, and indium
 does not enforce any linear-texture alignment for it to report: its
 replaceRegion: passes bytesPerRow straight through unvalidated. Returning a
 Vulkan limit such as optimalBufferCopyOffsetAlignment would answer a different
 question, since that bounds buffer copies rather than texture layout.

 The remaining omitted selectors are documented where the class that would have
 provided the object is declared: -newEvent in MTLSharedEvent.h,
 -newArgumentEncoderWithArguments: in MTLArgumentDescriptor.h,
 -newCommandQueueWithMaxCommandBufferCount: in MTLCommandQueue.h,
 -newBinaryArchiveWithDescriptor:error: in MTLBinaryArchive.h,
 -newCounterSampleBufferWithDescriptor:error: in MTLCounterSampleBuffer.h, and
 the acceleration-structure selectors in MTLAccelerationStructure.h. */
